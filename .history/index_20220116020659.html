        For every 30 Rupees that you donate, we will purchase one packet of sofy
        sanitary napkins that contain 8 pads. This packet of sanitary napkins
        will be distributed for free to girls in Govt. schools, slums,
        orphanages in the age group of 12 to 20.

      <p>
        At any given time, girls across India cannot afford sanitary napkins.
        Instead they use cloth, grass, newspapers and other unhygienic materials
        that increase their risk of contracting infections. It is estimated that
        over 80% of all women in India do not have access to sanitary products
        during menstruation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Female menstruation is still considered a social taboo and as such, 9
        out of 10 girls are unaware of their menstrual cycles. The ones who are
        aware of it are not open to talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who purchase their own sanitary products are all too familiar with
        their products being wrapped in paper to “shield” the public from any
        knowledge of the existence of a period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to raise awareness on gender issues and bring it out in
        the open. Through our programs, we teach young girls that their
        menstrual cycles are natural, a sign of good reproductive health and is
        something they have in common with girls in countries worldwide!
        Furthermore, we hold sessions with the mothers of the girls to bring the
        topic of menstruation out into the open, allow them to ask questions and
        look at menstruation for the natural and healthy process it is.
